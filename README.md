# Hello-World

![Banner](https://github.com/akshaysic/Hello-World/blob/main/Github%20Banner.png)

I'm an ML Student and senior product designer based between Berlin and Stockholm with 8+ years of experience in user-centered design. I focus on accessibility, intuitive UX, and creating meaningful digital experiences. My background spans web, mobile, and IoT design, working with companies like Airalo, IKEA, and Husqvarna.

Iâ€™m passionate about design that drives impact, blending usability research, information architecture, and interface design to create seamless user experiences. Currently, Iâ€™m learning Python and Machine Learning to bridge the gap between design and data-driven decision-making.

For my projects, I typically upload to GitHub once Iâ€™ve made significant progress, while smaller updates and markdown files get more frequent commits. Feel free to explore my repos and contribute via pull requests!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and ML to integrate data insights into design.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on Altrue, a microdonation platform, and design-driven experiments.
ðŸ˜€ I like making music, designing interfaces, and exploring generative visuals.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about UX, design systems, or synthesizers.
âš¡ Fun fact: My design approach is inspired by music compositionâ€”harmony and iteration.
